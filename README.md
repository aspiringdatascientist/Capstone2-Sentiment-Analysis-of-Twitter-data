# Capstone2-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-data
The goal of this project is to predict Twitter usersâ€™ political sentiment about electoral college in U.S. for the given Twitter post using Python based Machine learning NLP Classification model. Many Americans are critical of the Electoral College, an attitude that seems to have intensified since Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election despite losing the popular vote. This project explores on predicting how positive, neutral or negative each tweet is about electoral college. What is being said about Electoral College on social media? How has the sentiment changed over the years? We also want to understand the overall feelings towards Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the topic of electoral college.
